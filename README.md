# EV_Analysis

As part of my Advanced Data Analysis Bootcamp from With Avado, I completed an end-to-end project for Greenwish Ltd, a company that wanted to purchase a new fleet of cars for their sales representatives. I was given an Excel dataset of 194 vehicles, with data on variables such as electric range, battery power, and mileage in different weather conditions. I used Python to analyze the data and provide a conclusion on the most suitable cars for Greenwish Ltd's sales representatives.
